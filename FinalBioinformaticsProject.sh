#This shell script called FinalBioinformaticsProject.sh is to look for two genes in any target species.
#Arguments within the shell script are as follows $1=hsp70*.fasta reference genes, $2=mcr*.fasta reference genes, $3=proteome*.fasta target genes.
#The output containing target species with both reference genes will be presented in a table.

#We combine all files for gene1 into one fasta file
#Make sure that the directory for your tools hmmr and muscle correspond to your pathway. Ours are located two directories above. 
#We then align the files with muscle
#We then build a regular expression using the tool hmmbuild

cat $gene >> gene1.fa

#We want to put the matches[1,2].txt files into a combined file. However, we need to associated "Target Species" name with each line.
#We generate the table with the names of the "Target Species" with a for loop.
